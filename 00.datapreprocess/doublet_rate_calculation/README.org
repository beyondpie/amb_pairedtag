I did below procedures to calculate doublet rate in Exp1-13

1. I used doublet.analysis.R to summarize mouse barcodes, human barcodes and human-mouse shared barcodes.

2. I then counted the sum of mouse barcodes (#mouseBC), human barcodes(#humanBC) and human-mouse shared barcodes(#mixBC) associated with first round barcodes, where I experimentally spiked in Hela cells, as in mm10_hg38_doublet_20240213.xlsx.

3. In excel, I did below calculation:

    %mouseBC = #mouseBC/(#mouseBC + #humanBC)

    %humanBC = 1-%mouseBC

    %divisorFactor = 2 * %mouseBC * %humanBC

    %mixBC = #mixBC/(#mouseBC + #humanBC - #mixBC)

    %actualDoublet = %mixBC/%divisorFactor

The results are also shown in mm10_hg38_doublet_20240213.xlsx.
