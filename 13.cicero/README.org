     - =if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {install.packages("BiocManager")}=
     - =install.packages("devtools")=
  3. Then in R, use devtools to install ~monocle3~ and ~cicero~:
     - i. =BiocManager::install(c("Gviz", "GenomicRanges", "rtracklayer"))=
          If having difficulties to install them, try =mamba install= like above.
